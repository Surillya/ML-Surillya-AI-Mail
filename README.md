This project aims on letting you dynamically generate full dead internet email inboxes using local AI (Ollama recommended), based on local data you provide.

## Features

- Dark and modern design
- Completely local
- Doesn't require much input, but supports it, so it's very flexible
- Local login with hypothetical login detail (Name, Email and Biography)

## Usage & Examples

In Login you put any name you want to get emails to as, a email-adress (can be anything) and a biography about the character you're immitating.

## Installation

1. Make sure you've installed Ollama. If you don't, install it from https://ollama.com
2. Make sure you have the LLaMA3 model pulled w/Ollama.
- Open a command line (cmd in windows) and enter `ollama pull llama3`
3. Clone this repo, or download it as a ZIP and extract it somewhere
4. Make sure `serve` is installed via NPM
- If NPM is not installed, download it first from https://nodejs.org
- Do `npm install --global serve` in your command line.
5. In the directory where you have this repo extracted, open a command line
- On Windows, this can be done by clicking on the Adress-Bar in the file-explorer. Type in `cmd` into the adress-bar and press enter.
6. Serve the website with executing `serve`
7. You're done, just go to the adress that's shown in serve (typically http://localhost:3000/)
